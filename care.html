		<h2>Feeding</h2>
		<p>Puppies 8-12 weeks old need to be fed 4 meals a day. Meanwhile, puppies between 3-6 months old require 3 meals a day. A 6 month to 1 year old puppy needs 2 meals a day. Dogs over 1 year old, suffice from only 1 meal a day. Note that puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food. And premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs.</p>
		
		<h2>Exercise</h2>
		<p>Dogs need exercise to stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health.</p>
		
		<h2>Grooming</h2>
		<p>Keep your dog clean and reduce shedding by brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. When bathing a dog, make sure to carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.</p>
		
		<h2>Handling</h2>
		<p>To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.</p>
