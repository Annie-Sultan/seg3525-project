					<h1>Afghan Hound</h1>
					<h3>The Basics</h3>
					<p>Height: 25-27 inches</p>
					<p>Weight: 50-60 pounds</p>
					<p>Life Expectancy: 12-18 years</p>
					<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>The Afghan Hound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
					<h3>Grooming</h3>
					<p>Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called “monkey whiskers”) that require little maintenance. They don’t stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris.</p>
					<h3>Exercise</h3>
					<p>Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area.</p>

						<h1>Basset Hound</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: up to 15 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: 40-65 pounds</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 12-13 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Basset Hound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>Although it might seem that with his short, smooth hair the Basset Hound won’t need any grooming, that’s not quite the case. Regular grooming sessions are an important part of keeping the breed healthy and happy. The Basset’s short hair can shed profusely. Shedding can be kept under control by gently going over the dog at least once a week with a soft brush or a shedding tool.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>Basset Hounds are not as active as some breeds, but they do require regular, moderate exercise. Usually a daily walk at a moderate pace will fill the bill. Exercise will help to keep the Basset healthy and prevent him from becoming overweight. Since the breed was developed to work in a pack with other dogs, Bassets enjoy canine company on their outings, and the breed can be quite playful.</p>

						<div id="beagle-close" class="beagle-close">+</div>
						<h1>Beagle</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 13 inches & under, 13-15 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: under 20 pounds (13 inches & under), 20-30 pounds (13-15 inches)</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Beagle should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>The Beagle has a smooth, dense double coat that gets heavier in the winter, so spring is shedding season. Beagles also shed moderately year-round. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the loose hair, and promotes new hair growth as well. Beagles don’t need to be bathed too often, unless they happen to get into something particularly messy.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>Beagles are active, energetic dogs who need at least an hour of exercise every day. This doesn’t mean just letting them out in the backyard. Beagles were bred to work in packs and are happiest when they have company. A Beagle who is left alone inside or outside for long periods of time will tend to become destructive. </p>

						<h1>Bloodhound</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 25-27 inches (male), 23-25 inches (female)</p>
						<p>Weight: 90-110 pounds (male), 80-100 pounds (female)</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 10-12 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Bloodhound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>The Bloodhound has a short, dense coat that is shed once or twice a year. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the dead hair before it can fall onto the furniture. Brushing also promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to keep it healthy.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>The popular misconception is that Bloodhounds spend their days lazing on the front porch. The truth is that the Bloodhound, who was bred to follow a scent for hours on end, is an active dog who requires daily exercise. He will benefit from long daily walks—always on a leash, as he may not respond to commands if he has found a scent to follow.</p>

						<h1>Border Collie</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 19-22 inches (male), 18-21 inches (female)</p>
						<p>Weight: 30-55 pounds</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 12-15 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Border Collie should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>There are two types of coat in the breed. The rough coat is medium-length and feathered, while the smooth coat is shorter and coarser. Both are dense, weather-resistant double coats. Grooming is the same for both: going over the dog with a pin brush once or twice a week, more often if needed, to keep the coat free of mats, tangles, dirt, and debris.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>This high-drive, athletic breed is extremely energetic and requires daily exercise beyond just a walk around the block or a quick romp in the yard. They thrive when they have a job to do and space to run. A Border Collie who doesn’t work must be provided with vigorous exercise every day. Clearly, this is a breed for an active owner, and not for someone who prefers to stay indoors or who travels away from home frequently.</p>

						<h1>Boston Terrier</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 15-17 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: 12-25 pounds</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 11-13 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Boston Terrier should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>The Boston’s sleek, fine coat does shed somewhat, though not a lot. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will help to remove the loose hair. A good brushing also promotes new hair growth and distributes skin oils throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. Bostons need to be bathed only occasionally, unless they get into something messy.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>The Boston’s need for exercise varies from individual to individual. For some, a brisk walk once or twice a day will be enough. Others will need more time to run and play every day and let off steam. Simply letting a Boston out into the backyard doesn’t count as exercise—he’ll probably just sit at the door waiting to be let back in. Left alone for long periods of time, a Boston will tend to become frustrated and develop undesirable behaviors.</p>

						<h1>Bulldog</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 14-15 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: 50 pounds (male), 40 pounds (female)</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 8-10 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Bulldog should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>An all-over brushing with a soft brush for 10 minutes two or three times a week will keep the Bulldog looking his best. During periods of heavier shedding, it can help to first use a rubber curry brush. The wrinkles on the Bulldog’s face need to be regularly checked to make sure the skin is clean and dry, as food or moisture can get trapped and cause irritation or infection. A cotton ball dipped in peroxide can be used to clean the wrinkles, and cornstarch can be applied afterward to aid in drying—although neither should be used near the eyes.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>Bulldogs are mellow and are happy to relax next to their owner’s feet, but they also enjoy an occasional romp and going on walks. Moderate exercise will help the dog to stay trim. Very warm days are best spent in front of an air-conditioner, however, as the Bulldog’s short muzzle can make breathing difficult in heat and humidity.</p>

						<h1>Chihuahua</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 5-8 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: not exceeding 6 pounds</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 14-16 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Chihuahua should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>The two coat varieties of the Chihuahua have slightly different grooming needs. The smooth-coat Chihuahua will need only occasional brushing and regular baths to look dapper, while the longhaired variety should have his coat brushed at least once a week to avoid any tangles or mats. Both varieties should have their nails trimmed regularly.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>The Chihuahua loves to run and play and can usually get enough exercise in a very small space. Simply trotting around following their people is usually enough exercise for this happy breed. Short, slow walks will keep your dog in good weight and condition. Avoid overexerting the Chihuahua. If your dog is panting and working hard to keep up, it’s time to pick him up and carry him home.</p>

						<h1>Dachshund</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 8-9 inches (standard), 5-6 inches (miniature)</p>
						<p>Weight: 16-32 pounds (standard), 11 pounds & under (miniature)</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 12-16 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Dachshund should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>Dachshunds are moderate shedders, relatively clean, and have little or no body odor. The breed’s grooming needs vary with the three coat types. Smooth-coated Dachshunds are somewhat “wash and wear,” needing little beyond a wipe with a towel or hound glove to look dapper. Longhaired Dachshunds may require more frequent brushing, depending on the thickness of the coat. The Wirehaired coat can be plucked or hand-stripped several times a year to look its best.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>Many owners think that because they are so small, Dachshunds don’t require more exercise than just running around the house. However, they do need regular exercise not only to stay fit, but also to build strong muscles to support and protect their back. Two walks every day of moderate length should be sufficient.</p>

						<h1>Dalmatian</h1>
						<h3>The Basics</h3>
						<p>Height: 19-24 inches</p>
						<p>Weight: 45-70 pounds</p>
						<p>Life Expectancy: 11-13 years</p>
						<h3>Nutrition</h3>
						<p>The Dalmatian should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
						<h3>Grooming</h3>
						<p>The Dalmatian’s coat is a thing of beauty with its colored spots on a sparkling white background, and it doesn’t take much work to keep it in good condition. Occasional baths and weekly brushing with a horsehair mitt or rubber curry comb to pull away dead hairs will keep the Dal looking his best.</p>
						<h3>Exercise</h3>
						<p>All Dalmatians need regular exercise to stay fit and happy. This exercise can consist of chasing a ball tossed across the backyard, running alongside a biking or jogging owner, or taking a nice, long hike through the woods. Since a puppy’s bones and joints aren’t at their mature strength until two years of age, be wary of strenuously exercising the dog before then. Dalmatians can be very high-energy dogs and can easily get into mischief if they don’t have enough opportunity for physical and mental exercise.</p>

							<h1>Golden Retriever</h1>
							<h3>The Basics</h3>
							<p>Height: 23-24 inches (male), 21.5-22.5 inches (female)</p>
							<p>Weight: 65-75 pounds (male), 55-65 pounds (female)</p>
							<p>Life Expectancy: 10-12 years</p>
							<h3>Nutrition</h3>
							<p>The Golden Retriever should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
							<h3>Grooming</h3>
							<p>Goldens heavily shed their thick, water-repellant double coat once or twice a year, and they also shed more moderately on a continuous basis. Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. During times of heavy shedding, these brushing sessions turn into daily affairs. Baths help to loosen the dead hairs, but the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>Like most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn’t get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog’s bones and joints.</p>

							<h3>The Basics</h3>
							<p>Height: 28-30 inches (male), 27-28 inches (female)</p>
							<p>Weight: 65-70 pounds (male), 60-65 pounds (female)</p>
							<p>Life Expectancy: 10-13 years</p>
							<h3>Nutrition</h3>
							<p>The Greyhound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
							<h3>Grooming</h3>
							<p>The Greyhound’s short, smooth coat requires little grooming beyond regular baths and weekly rubdowns with a damp cloth or hound glove. His strong, fast-growing nails should be trimmed regularly if not worn down naturally, as overly long nails can cause the dog discomfort. The ears should be checked at least weekly for any buildup of wax or debris that could result in an infection, and cleaned if needed.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>The Greyhound is the cheetah of the dog world. While perfectly happy to lounge around the house all day, he is capable of amazing speed and energy when faced with potential prey—or the chance to chase a tennis ball or a coursing lure. Greyhounds require a regular schedule of exercise time and opportunities to (safely) run full-out.</p>

							<p>Weight: under 7 pounds</p>
							<p>Life Expectancy: 12-15 years</p>
							<h3>Nutrition</h3>
							<p>The Maltese should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
							<h3>Grooming</h3>
							<p>The long, white coat of the Maltese is eye-catching and glorious. It requires daily gentle brushing and combing to the skin to prevent mats and tangles. Maltese should also have regular baths and coat conditioning to keep their hair looking its best. They have fast-growing nails that should be trimmed regularly. Check their ears weekly, and remove any excess hair or wax and any accumulated debris.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>Maltese are full of energy but require only occasional exercise to keep them healthy and happy. Daily walks with their owner or bouncing around in their fenced yard, or even indoors, will usually suffice to keep them fit.</p>

							<p>Height: 6-9 inches</p>
							<p>Weight: up to 14 pounds</p>
							<p>Life Expectancy: 12-14 years</p>
							<h3>Nutrition</h3>
							<p>The Pekingese should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
							<h3>Grooming</h3>
							<p>The thick double coat of the Pekingese requires a good bit of maintenance. Pekingese shed seasonally. Brushing him at least one hour per week will help to remove loose hairs and prevent matting, and an occasional bath will help to keep him looking his best. Mats or tangles can be gently worked out with a slicker brush or metal comb.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>Pekingese are charming, confident companions who develop a close bond with their people. Their whole purpose in life is to amuse and comfort. Although they are fairly sedate most of the time and have only modest exercise requirements, they do enjoy participating in canine sports at their own pace.</p>

							<p>Life Expectancy: 10-18 years</p>
							<h3>Nutrition</h3>
							<p>The Poodle should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior).</p>
							<h3>Grooming</h3>
							<p>Unless you plan to keep your Poodle clipped in a short trim, you will need to learn how to brush how to brush him daily to keep his coat from matting. If you do not brush and comb a full-coated Poodle completely to the skin, the hair will mat near the roots and will have to be shaved off to start all over with new growth.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>Poodles of any size are very active dogs who require good exercise every day to suit their high energy level. Poodles are eager for all kinds of activity, and they enjoy keeping busy. Swimming is great exercise for them, and most Poodles love to get in the water. Bred as hunting dogs, their impulse is to retrieve, so tossing toys, sticks, or balls for them will exercise both their mind and body. They also thrive on going for jogs or long walks with their human.</p>

							<p>A Shih Tzu with a long coat requires daily brushing. Use a good-quality wire brush with flexible pins, and layer the hair to be sure you reach to the skin. A bath about every three or four weeks will help to keep the coat clean and at its best. Remember to comb the mustache and topknot daily, and gently clean the corner of the eyes with a damp cloth. To protect the Shih Tzu’s eyes from being irritated, the hair on the top of the head should be trimmed short or tied up into a topknot.</p>
							<h3>Exercise</h3>
							<p>The Shih Tzu was bred to be a house companion. As such, they require minimal exercise. Short daily walks with their owner and indoor playtime will satisfy the activity needs of this small, short-legged companion.</p>
